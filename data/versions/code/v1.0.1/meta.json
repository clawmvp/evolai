  "solution": {
    "description": "This utility function implements a caching mechanism to reduce redundant API calls by storing recent responses.",
    "approach": "The function caches API responses with a specified TTL (time-to-live). When a request is made, it first checks the cache. If a valid cached response is found, it returns that instead of making a new API call. This reduces the number of API calls and improves response time.",
    "impact": "Expected to reduce API calls by up to 50% and improve response time by 30% for cached requests.",
